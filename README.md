A CSS Selector Specificity graph based on the Inverted Triangle CSS Methodology

## This repo uses:

* [Alan Menhennet's SVG Line Graph](http://codepen.io/alanmenhennet/pen/WxrXww)
* [CSS Selectors to JS Array](http://github.com/TheJaredWilcurt/css-selectors-to-js-array)
* [SPECIFICITY](https://github.com/keeganstreet/specificity)
* [GitHub Corners](http://tholman.com/github-corners/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [Meyer Resets](http://github.com/TheJaredWilcurt/meyer-sass)
* [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)


## Contribute:

* The design could be improved
* Need to go and clean up the Sass folder, it should *really* be set up to use ITCSS (yeah, that needs fixed)
* We need lots of testing of the [CSS Selectors to JS Array](http://github.com/TheJaredWilcurt/css-selectors-to-js-array) library. To make sure all valid CSS can be parsed correctly.
* Add in a CSS Validator library. Prevent CSS parsing unless the file is valid. If the file is invalid, display a warning.
* Would be nice to have some simple ITCSS [explaination](http://imgur.com/a/6fS7V) on the page.
